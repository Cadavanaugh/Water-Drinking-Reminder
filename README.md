# 💧 Water Drinking Reminder 💧

## 🤔 The problem

Have you ever stop to notice how many hours per day you spent in front of pc without taking a single sip of water? Try not to overthink about it, but I’m pretty sure you wish you had been hydrating yourself more lately.

I made Water Drinking Reminder to be a simple console application to remember you just to **drink water.** 

But unlikely those well-known apps where you have to drink a certain amount of water per day, my idea is just to remember you to take a small sip of water every time. Not needing to worry about how much you’re drinking.

## ⚙️ How does it work?

The program will sort a number from 1 to 1800 everytime the loop iterates to create a break ranging 1 second to 30 minutes. This will be used to make a random interval between water sips, so it doesn’t get predictable.

When clock hits, the sound of a glass being filled with water will play. This is your warning to drink some water.
